		<p>I'm obsessed with good writing - consuming it, analyzing it, producing it, and then picking it apart to make it better. I'm almost as much of a perfectionist about writing as I am about coffee. (And let's be honest, without copious coffee fueling me, nary a sentence would be written on this page). As much as quality writing gets me going, though, the real prize is <em>effective</em> writing. That's my goal, and that's what I've dedicated the past decade of my life to mastering. </p>
